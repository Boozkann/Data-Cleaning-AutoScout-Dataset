This project involves the transformation of raw data scraped from the Autoscout24 website. The dataset, initially in an unstructured and messy format, was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Power Query within Power BI.

# Key steps of the project include:

- Importing and exploring raw data from Autoscout24

- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

- Structuring the dataset to make it suitable for analysis

- Creating insightful visualizations in Power BI

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data preprocessing and visualization techniques using real-world data from a popular online car marketplace.
